## Hey there! 👋 I'm Miguel Angel Munoz, a software engineering student 🎓 

<p>

### About me 

with more than 1 year of experience in web and mobile application development. 
I am passionate about programming and am proficient in frontend technologies such as React, Next.js, Webpack, Vite and React Native, 
as well as languages such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS, including css styling preprocessors such as Sass. 
I'm also familiar with popular libraries like Tailwind CSS and Material UI, and have worked on projects within monorepositories. 
When it comes to coding, I'm a TypeScript and GraphQL enthusiast for frontend projects.

### Backend Mode 🔥

*On the backend side*, I've worked with *Node.js* and *Java* to build RESTful APIs and GraphQL. 
I also have experience creating Docker containers, managing databases with MySQL and PostgreSQL, and implementing JWT-based authentication. 
I am a big proponent of unit testing and have used Jest in several projects.

### No code 🌪️
Beyond technical skills, I also know how to create websites without code, using tools like Webflow, Drupal and WordPress.
